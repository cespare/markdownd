# markdownd

markdownd is a markdown renderer for your command-line. It can also serve the rendered markdown to your
browser and reload it automatically when the file changes.

markdownd is based on [markdown_doctor](https://github.com/dmacdougall/markdown_doctor) (to which I am also a
contributor). However, markdownd is written in Go and is more easily distributed (no need for Ruby and
Rubygems).
